# SDK & Tooling Updates

Stay up to date with the latest tooling from Moddable and supported device targets. As with the [`setup`](./setup) command, the current dev environment (Mac or Linux) is the default selected target:

```
xs-dev update
```

The `--device` flag allows for selecting a different target platform:

```
xs-dev update --device esp32
```

_There may be some platforms that are supported by the `setup` command but not `update` yet._
